# Changelog for Squinktronix plugins

## 2.2.2

Harmony stuff other than score drawing:

* Re-specify the ranges. Now "narrow" is very similar to old "don't care", and "don't care" is now even wider.
* Enhanced rules for no-notes in common.
* Changed defaults to "narrow mode".
* Added rules for leading tone in chords, and for chords whose root is the leading tone.

Harmony score drawing:

* Use standard figured bass chord notation.
* Adjust spacing of score layout to make it more readable.

Phase patterns is now disabled (not visible to normal users).

Changed license terms.

Harmony:

* New default values for Harmony preference (inversions, and centered).
* Fixed memory leak in Harmony module.
* Sped up evaluation of harmony rules.

New Harmony rules:

* Forbid doubling of leading tones.
* Chord of the leading tone prevented in root position.

* Discourage motion in Bass, Tenor, and Alto. But less restrictive than the Soprano rule.
* Implement the piston rule for V-VI progression.

Arpeggiator:

* Fixed bug where notes stuck when reducing polyphony with mono gates.

Phase Patterns:

* Added "under construction" to the panel. For more on that, look at the manual.
