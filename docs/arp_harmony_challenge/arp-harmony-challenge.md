# ParpHarmony Challenge (March 2024)

On 3/3/2024 VCV user Alphagem-O launched a challenge for users to create patches that used both Harmony and Apreggiator, and to limit their submissions to free modules. The [original post and submissions](https://community.vcvrack.com/t/arpharmony-challenge-march-2024/21722) are on the VCV Community site.

The submissions were all quite interesting, so I and copying links here. I will attempt to present all the submissions in the order they were submitted.

Note that I have reduced the resolution of some images. The full res versions can be found in the original post.
