# ArpHarmony Challenge (March 2024)

On 3/3/2024 VCV user Alphagem-O launched a challenge for users to create patches that used both Harmony and Apreggiator, and to limit their submissions to free modules. The [original post and submissions](https://community.vcvrack.com/t/arpharmony-challenge-march-2024/21722) are on the VCV Community site.

The submissions were all quite interesting, so I am copying links here. I will attempt to present all the submissions in the order they were submitted.

Note that I have reduced the resolution of some images. The full res versions can be found in the original post.

Note 2: If you click on some of the links (like the .vcv links) they may open up in github. If you want to download them, right click and download.

"This is a “duet” between my Meander module and the Squintronix Harmony and Arpeggiator modules. Meander provides the chord progression and various rhythms as well as playing an accompanying melody and arp in the same key as Harmony and Arpeggiator. Meander provides the progression chords root to Harmony. Arp provides an arpeggiation of the Harmony 4 voice chords. There is a lot of parameter automation going on for Meander. This is in A-maj (Ionian) and is a traditional 12 bar blues progression. BASICally provides two scripts to translate between Meander mode and root and Harmony mode and root so that Harmony plays in the same key a the Meander."

"Ok here is my small contribution for the ArpHarmony March 2024 Challenge. The sequence is called “Finnish Ruisleipä”, which literally means “Finnish rye bread”. I think the sequence is pretty dry. That’s why the name. BTW…Squinktronix Plugs" are pretty neat and I use them a lot when it comes to arpeggio stuff. It actually took me a long time to get these plugins to work for me. But that was another highlight.

To start this Patch.

Hit Spacebar to reset all the stuff. Click on the Master fader. 8Face has 8 snapshots 1 to 8 For me I Start with 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 (from Top to down) This is just for to mix the faders."

"This is an ambient composition using VCV Rack created for the March 2024 ArpHarmony Challenge on the VCV Rack forums. Tides come in and go out. I’m new to VCV Rack but have been enjoying my time with it a great deal given the endless possibilities. Enjoy!"

## Alphagem-O entry

"Tried to do something slightly different here: The notes of one of the arps are translated into gates for a tabla (Tala, Seaside Modular) and routed to different sounds depending on their pitch. This was accomplished using a simple comparison script for BASICally (Stochastic Telegraph). The rhythm periodically changes randomly (NoteSeq16, JW) and also is different every time the patch is run, so it becomes a syncopated, polyrhythmic-ish, electroautomatic improvisation dispersed in the luminiferous aether of the unknown, LOL.

Other rhythmic elements emerge from the Euclidian sequencers Eugene and Polygene (both Rare Breeds). A lead, pad, kick and washy snare fill empty spaces.

RGATE (Bogaudio) is guided by 8Face (stoermelder) to change clock divisions, selectively speeding up or slowing down the tempo. Arranged using ShapeMaster (MindMeld)."

"Great challenge for me as I have had a lot of fun trying these two out. Thanks for the work you’ve put in. This piece for the Squinktronix ArpHarmony challenge uses four voices each linked via an Arpeggiator or Harmony module. Each occupies a separate row in the patch.

1. Arpeggiator working with 8 random pitches from 8vert with the arpeggio direction/order determined randomly from six.
2. Harmony generates a four part chord per note of the arpeggio.
3. Harmony do the same but less frequently
4. Arpeggiator working with the chord from the Harmony row 3.

I was very interested to explore the harmony of Harmony contrasted again the un quantized input. The STRIP module from stoermelder is such a handy module for the randomizing. I also use it a couple of times to turn off the 8vert. Harmony does a return to smooth harmony beautifully when that happens. I’d never come across either module so thanks for the challenge poking me in the right place! I hope you enjoy the results."
