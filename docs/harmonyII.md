# Squinktronix Harmony II manual

Harmony II is a chord generator with a trick - it can generate the correct chords for they key that you set. For example, in the key of C Major, the triads in the key are C Major, D minor, E minor, F Major, G Major, A minor, and B diminished. Most chord generators would tend to generate all the same chord at different patches, like C Major, D Major, etc...

Most chord generators are unable to generate the "correct" chords at different pitches. For an in-depth look at this, see [analysis of chord transpostion](./more-on-harmony.md/#analysis-of-quantizers)
