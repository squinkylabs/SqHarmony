    //  zero frequency, and 1.0 is the sample rate. Of course in any DSP we can never do things above sample
    //  rate / 2, so this must never be greater than .5.

    //  2) The VCV biquad lets you set it up by specifying a type of response, a frequency, a "Q", and a gain.
    //  we use 1 for the gain, and the caller specifies the cutoff. We tell VCV we want a LOWPASS filter, which
    //  it interprets as "two pole low pass". And we pass in these magic numbers for "Q". There are ways you
